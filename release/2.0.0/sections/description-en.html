<h2 id="desc" class="list">Heritage Text Ontology: Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>

In section introduces the classes and properties used to represent Textual Heritage from the following aspects:

<ul>
    <li><a href="#desc-biblio">Bibliographic Metadata</a></li>
    <li><a href="#desc-content">Textual Content</a></li>
    <li><a href="#desc-annotation">Annotation</a></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="desc-biblio">Bibliographical Metadata</h3>

<p>Bibliographic Metadata here mainly contains elements used to identify and retrieve a specific historical textual resource.
    To be more specific, bibliographic metadata can be described in HTO includes the type (Edition, Series, Volume...) of the heritage resource,
    title, subtitle, language, genre, printing location, year published. More metadata such as editor, publisher can be expressed by reusing schema.org ontology.
    Archival structure (e.g. a collection has several editions, a volume has several pages) can be captured using schema:hasPart</p>
<br>
<p>
    An example of using this ontology to represent bibliographic metadata for Encyclopaedia Britannica (EB) collection is shown
    in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. In this example, the overall structure of the EB collection is pictured using `schema:hasPart` property.
    The collection <span style="color: red">ex:EncyclopaediaBritannica</span> hasPart edition <span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7</span> (the seven edition of EB)
    and a supplement edition (<span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7Supplement</span>). <span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7</span>
    hasPart volume <span style="color: red">ex:EBE7Volume2</span>(the second volume of the seven edition of EB). As `schema:hasPart` is used to link two `schema:CreativeWork`,
    the historical works in this example are `schema:CreativeWork` as well, this can be identified by a reasoner.

<h3 id="desc-content">Textual Content</h3>

<p>Textual content here means the printed or handwritten text in a textual heritage. The knowledge hidden in the textual content
    is essential to a wide range of researches. However, there are several problems remaining unsolved when it comes to digitalising
    historical textual documents:

    <ol>
        <li>when their content was transcribed either manually or automatically via optical character recognition (OCR) or handwritten
    text recognition (HTR), text quality of the content varies.</li>
        <li>retrieving information on historical documents (such as identifying entity of interest in texts, and semantic relations among entities) is difficult.
    It faces the challenges of domain heterogeneity, input noisiness, dynamics of language, and lack of resources (such as fine-tuned language models).</li>
    </ol>

    To accommodate these problems, this ontology are designed to:
    <ol>
        <li>
            capture textual content extracted from sources provided by different data providers, along with the text quality, provenance information
    about how the text was extracted and how sources are generated. This allows comparison among text with different qualities
    as well as tools to generate the text, and possibly provides insight to clean the text.
        </li>
        <li>
            be extendable and flexible to adopt new entity and relations which would be automatically identified from the textual
    content in the future.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> highlights the key terms to express the relations among historical work, concept from the work, and textual content
    of the work or concept. It also reflects the design associated with above problems.

<h3 id="desc-annotation">Annotation</h3>

<p>Annotations highlight extra information about resources. Here, we mainly use annotations to connect parts of textual
    content with associated historical entities (places, persons, events). HTO reuses the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/">Web Annotation Vocabulary</a> for representing annotations.</p>

</div>

<p>
    <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> highlights the key terms used to represent annotations for textual content (<a href="#OriginalDescription">OriginalDescription</a>),
    and we use suffix "oa:" to indicate the terms from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/">Web Annotation Vocabulary</a>.
    The core class, <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#Annotation">oa:Annotation</a>, uses <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#hasBody">oa:hasBody</a> and
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#hasTarget">oa:hasTarget</a> properties to connect resources
    (bodies and targets respectively), thus showing that a body is related to a target. In this ontology, we mainly use a part of an OriginalDescription as a target, which is an instance
    of (<a href="#TextSegment">OriginalDescription</a>). We mainly use an agent (such as a person or organisation) or location as a body.
    In this case, an annotation can be used to show that a part of a textual content refers to an agent or a location.
