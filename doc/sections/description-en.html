<h2 id="desc" class="list">Heritage Text Ontology: Description <span class="backlink"> back to <a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h2>

In section introduces the classes and properties used to represent Textual Heritage from the following aspects:

<ul>
    <li><a href="#desc-biblio">Bibliographic Metadata</a></li>
    <li><a href="#desc-content">Textual Content</a></li>
    <li><a href="#desc-annotation">Annotation</a></li>
    <li><a href="#desc-geospatial">Geospatial data</a></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="desc-biblio">Bibliographical Metadata</h3>

<p>Bibliographic Metadata here mainly contains elements used to identify and retrieve a specific historical textual resource.
    To be more specific, bibliographic metadata can be described in HTO includes the type (Edition, Series, Volume...) of the heritage resource,
    title, subtitle, abstract, name, language, genre, printing location, editor, year published, structure (e.g. a collection has several editions,
    a volume has several pages), et al.</p>

<p><a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a> highlights the key terms used to describe bibliographic metadata. <a href="#Work">Work</a>
    (equivalent to <a href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork">schema:CreativeWork</a>) is the core class representing "The most generic kind of creative work"
    (<a href="http://schema.org/CreativeWork">schema:CreativeWork</a>). It is mainly used for Textual Heritage here. The type of
    Textual Heritage can be expressed by defining it as a specific <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#subClassOf-def">subclass</a> of Work.
    The metadata is expressed through data properties and object properties whose domain is Work, subclass of Work, or
    superclass of Work - <a href="#EntityWithProvenance">EntityWithProvenance</a> (equivalent to <a href="#http://www.w3.org/ns/prov#Entity">prov:Entity</a>).
    Taking advantage of ontology reuse, properties not included in HTO, but documented for schema:CreativeWork can be utilised as well.
    The structure of resource is described using a chain of <a href="#hadMember">hadMember</a> property.
    For example, a WorkCollection <em>W1</em> hadMember Edition <em>E1</em>, <em>E1</em> as WorkCollection hadMember
    Volume <em>V1</em>.

<br>
<p>
    An example of using this ontology to represent bibliographic metadata for Encyclopaedia Britannica (EB) collection is shown
    in <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>. In this example, the overall structure of the EB collection is pictured using hadMember property.
    The collection <span style="color: red">ex:EncyclopaediaBritannica</span> hadMember edition <span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7</span> (the seven edition of EB)
    and a supplement edition (<span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7Supplement</span>). <span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7</span>
    hadMember volume <span style="color: red">ex:EBE7Volume2</span>(the second volume of the seven edition of EB).
    As shown in Figure 1, the domain of this property is prov:Collection, which means the instance which uses this property
    (tail of the arrow) should be a prov:Collection. Similarly, instance which receives this relation (head of the arrow)
    should a hto:EntityWithProvenance. Therefore, <span style="color: red">ex:EncyclopaediaBritannica</span>, <span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7</span>,
    <span style="color: red">ex:EBE7Volume2</span> are type of prov:Collection, and <span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7Supplement</span>,
    <span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7</span>, <span style="color: red">ex:EBE7Volume2</span>, <span style="color: red">ex:EBE7Volume2page93</span>
    are type of hto:EntityWithProvenance.
</p>

<p>
    This example states that <span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7</span> hadSupplement <span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7Supplement</span>), that's to say, they
    are both type of hto:Work, and they are not same resource since hadSupplement is <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/#Asymmetric_Object_Properties">asymmetric</a>.
    This example also shows that <span style="color: red">ex:EBEdition7</span> has two editors <span style="color: red">ex:StewartDugald</span> and
    <span style="color: red">ex:LeslieJohn</span>.

<h3 id="desc-content">Textual Content</h3>

<p>Textual content here means the printed or handwritten text in a textual heritage. The knowledge hidden in the textual content
    is essential to a wide range of researches. However, there are several problems remaining unsolved when it comes to digitalising
    historical textual documents:

    <ol>
        <li>when their content was transcribed either manually or automatically via optical character recognition (OCR) or handwritten
    text recognition (HTR), text quality of the content varies.</li>
        <li>retrieving information on historical documents (such as identifying entity of interest in texts, and semantic relations among entities) is difficult.
    It faces the challenges of domain heterogeneity, input noisiness, dynamics of language, and lack of resources (such as fine-tuned language models).</li>
    </ol>

    To accommodate these problems, this ontology are designed to:
    <ol>
        <li>
            capture textual content extracted from sources provided by different data providers, along with the text quality, provenance information
    about how the text was extracted and how sources are generated. This allows comparison among text with different qualities
    as well as tools to generate the text, and possibly provides insight to clean the text.
        </li>
        <li>
            be extendable and flexible to adopt new entity and relations which would be automatically identified from the textual
    content in the future.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>

<p>
    <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> highlights the key terms to express the relations among historical work, concept from the work, and textual content
    of the work or concept. It also reflects the design associated with above problems.
</p>

<p>
    The relation between Work and Concept can be viewed in two ways. From the perspective of a Work, it could contain multiple concept records,
    we call such a record as <a href="#InternalRecord">InternalRecord</a> (a record which was mentioned or described  in a work),
    which is subclass of <a href="#ConceptRecord">ConceptRecord</a>, and some concept records could represent (<a href="#wasConceptRecordOf">wasConceptRecordOf</a>, the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#inverseOf-def">inverseOf</a> <a href="#hadConceptRecord">hadConceptRecord</a>) the
    same <a href="#Concept">Concept</a>. If putting it another way around, a Concept could have multiple
    concept records, and each internal record, as a type of concept record, was recorded in a specific work.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="#OriginalDescription">OriginalDescription</a> as a kind of <a href="#Description">Description</a>
    is used to express the original content of a Work or an Internal Record using <a href="#hasOriginalDescription">hasOriginalDescription</a> property.
    Note that a Work or an Internal Record could have multiple OriginalDescriptions extracted from different sources (EntityWithProvenance). These descriptions could have
    different <a href="#TextQuality">TextQuality</a>. The provenance information of the description and sources can be easily expressed
    using terms in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROV ontology</a>, since the core structure of this ontology
    is built on the base of core classes (prov:Agent, prov:Entity and prov:Activity) from PROV ontology.
</p>

<p>
    As an example of flexible design, this ontology can represent the content of not only a specific internal record but also
    a work in general (shown in <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). This is particularly useful when internal concept records in the work can not be automatically recognised due to limited
    information extraction methods. In addition, InternalRecord can be easily further specialised and expanded based on the level of information extraction.
    For example, we have method to automatically extract articles from EB, so <a href="#TermRecord">TermRecord</a>
    as a subclass of InternalRecord was defined to represent the article in EB. In the future, there might be tools to extract other types of
    records (such as people, place, et al.) highly accurately, and they should be defined as subclass of InternalRecord.

<br>
<p>
    <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> shows an example of how to use HTO to represent the textual content and articles in
    Encyclopaedia Britannica collection. In this example, two concepts are introduced: <span style="color: red">ex:musical_accent</span>
    (accent in musical domain) and <span style="color: red">ex:linguistic_accent</span> (accent in linguistic domain).
    <span style="color: red">ex:musical_accent</span> has two term records: <span style="color: red">ex:musical_accent_eb_e5</span> recorded in
    a page in 5th edition (the relation between Page and Edition can be found in <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>), <span style="color: red">ex:musical_accent_eb_e7</span>
    recorded in a page in 7th edition. These two similar records are linked through <a href="#similarTo">similarTo</a> property.
    <span style="color: red">ex:linguistic_accent</span> has one term record <span style="color: red">ex:linguistic_accent_eb_e7</span> which is recorded in
    another page in 7th edition. The description of this record mentioned another term record <span style="color: red">ex:reading_eb_e7</span>,
    and they are linked through <a href="#refersTo">refersTo</a> property.
</p>

<p>
    This example also shows that the term record <span style="color: red">ex:linguistic_accent_eb_e7</span> has two original descriptions:
    <span style="color: red">ex:accent1_eb_definition_nls</span> (less clean text extracted from the source which is generated by agent2),
    and <span style="color: red">ex:accent1_eb_definition_nckp</span> (more clean text extracted from the source which is generated by agent
    <span style="color: red">ex:nckp</span> using the software agent <span style="color: red">ex:ocr_tool</span>).

    Besides the original description for term records, this example also demonstrates the expression of textual content in the whole page.
    The page <span style="color: red">ex:eb_e7_vx_pagey</span> has an original description <span style="color: red">ex:pagey_content</span>.

<h3 id="desc-annotation">Annotation</h3>

<p>Annotations highlight extra information about resources. Here, we mainly use annotations to connect parts of textual
    content with associated historical entities (places, persons, events). HTO reuses the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/">Web Annotation Vocabulary</a> for representing annotations.</p>

        An arrow in this diagram does not necessarily indicate the range or the domain, but their subclasses.

</div>

<p>
    <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> highlights the key terms used to represent annotations for textual content (<a href="#OriginalDescription">OriginalDescription</a>),
    and we use suffix "oa:" to indicate the terms from <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-vocab/">Web Annotation Vocabulary</a>.
    The core class, <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#Annotation">oa:Annotation</a>, uses <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#hasBody">oa:hasBody</a> and
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#hasTarget">oa:hasTarget</a> properties to connect resources
    (bodies and targets respectively), thus showing that a body is related to a target. In this ontology, we mainly use a part of an OriginalDescription as a target, which is an instance
    of <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#SpecificResource">oa:SpecificResource</a>. We mainly use an agent (such as a person or organisation) or location as a body.
    In this case, an annotation can be used to show that a part of a textual
    content refers to an agent or a location. As an example in <a href="#fig5">Figure 6</a>, the oa:SpecificResource <span style="color: red">ex:st_andrews_def_nls_s1</span>
    representing the first two words of the OriginalDescription <span style="color: red">ex:st_andrews_def_nls</span>, "St Andrews",
    refers to the specific location <span style="color: red">ex:st_andrews</span>.
    The property <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#hasSource">oa:hasSource</a> is used to describe where an oa:SpecificResource from. We use <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#hasSelector">oa:hasSelector</a>
    to link an oa:SpecificResource with an oa:Selector which selects a specific part of its source. Here, we utilise two main selectors:
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#TextQuoteSelector">oa:TextQuoteSelector</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#TextPositionSelector">oa:TextPositionSelector</a>.
    An oa:TextQuoteSelector describes the selected text, text before and after selected one using properties <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#exact">oa:exact</a>,
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#prefix">oa:prefix</a>and <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#suffix">oa:suffix</a>respectively.
    An oa:TextPositionSelector then describes the start (0 as the first position) and end position of the selected text using <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#start">oa:start</a>
    and <a href="http://www.w3.org/ns/oa#end">oa:end</a>oa:end. Take "St Andrews" in <span style="color: red">ex:st_andrews_def_nls</span> for example,
    the oa:TextPositionSelector should have start position 0, end position 10.

<h3 id="desc-geospatial">Geospatial Data</h3>

<p>In the previous version, there are lack of precise and well identified representations of geolocation. Here, we have extended this ontology to
    support <a href="https://www.ogc.org/publications/">OGC standards</a> for geospatial information. Geospatial software vendors, developers and users collaborate in the OGC’s consensus process to
    develop and agree on standards that enable information systems to exchange geospatial information and instructions for geoprocessing. One of these standard,
    <a href="https://www.ogc.org/publications/standard/geosparql/">GeoSPARQL</a>, supports representing and querying geospatial data on the Semantic Web. It is reused in the
    extension of this ontology, along with <a href="https://cidoc-crm.org/crmgeo">CRMgeo</a>, a formal ontology which combines OGC standards for geospatial information
    and the ISO standard for cultural heritage information. In this version, we only integrated the core parts from CRMgeo ontology and GeoSPARQL ontology as we mainly focus on the precise expression
    of geometric place defined by WGS84 coordinate system.
    More advanced and complex features can be added from these two reused ontologies in the future.

<p>
     <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a> highlights the key terms used to represent the Geospatial Data. Two subclasses of Location are introduced: <a href="#http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#Feature">geo:Feature</a> and
    <a href="#http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#Geometry">geo:Geometry</a>. geo:Feature defined as "A discrete spatial phenomenon in a universe of discourse" highlights
    the real world phenomenon, such as the place "St Andrews exsited in 19th century"
    (see ex:st_andrews_19c in Figure 8). geo:Geometry defined as "A coherent set of direct positions in space.
    The positions are held within a Spatial Reference System (SRS)", on the other hand, highlights world described by information, such as the place (see <span style="color: red">ex:st_andrews_19c_boundary</span> in Figure 8)
    defined through set of WGS84 coordinates representing the boundary of St Andrews exsited in 19th century. A geo:Feature can have many associated geo:Geometry linked by the property
    <a href="#http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#hasGeometry">geo:hasGeometry</a>.
    To emphasize places in historical domain, we introduced <a href="#http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/SP2_Phenomenal_Place">cidoc-crm:SP2_Phenomenal_Place</a>
    and <a href="#http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/SP6_Declarative_Place">cidoc-crm:SP6_Declarative_Place</a> from CRMgeo ontology as
    subclasses of geo:Feature adn geo:Geometry respectively. For example, in figure 8, the <span style="color: red">ex:st_andrews_19c</span> has two geometries
    <span style="color: red">ex:st_andrews_19c_centroid</span> and <span style="color: red">ex:st_andrews_19c_boundary</span> which represent
    the central point and boundary of <span style="color: red">ex:st_andrews_19c</span>. Note that <a href="#http://www.opengis.net/ont/geosparql#hasCentroid">geo:hasCentroid</a> is a subclass of geo:hasGeometry, and describes central point of a place.
    This extended design for geospatial data is aligned with the specification of GeoSPARQL which has description of mapping GeoSPARQL to other ontologies.
    In addition to address spatial containment, we reused the property <a href="#http://www.cidoc-crm.org/cidoc-crm/P89_falls_within">cidoc-crm:P89_falls_within</a>.
    Also, we introduced <a href="#LocationType">LocationType</a> mainly for administrative divisions, such as town, county, city.
    Therefore, this expression, St Andrews is a town within the county Fife, can be <span style="color: red">ex:st_andrews_19c</span> hasLocationType
    <a href="#Town">hto:Town</a> and cidoc-crm:P89_falls_within <span style="color: red">ex:fife_19c</span> which hasLocationType <a href="#County">hto:County</a>.
